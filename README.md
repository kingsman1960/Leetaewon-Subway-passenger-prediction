# Leetaewon-Subway-passenger-prediction
With FBprophet, I predicted the board-in passengers at Leetaewon Station, which located at Line 6 in Seoul.
I got inspired from how the COVID-19 re-breakdown by visitors from the LGBTQ+ club "King Club" and other 2 pubs allocated at Leetaewon area
affects to the usage of public transportation (subway).
